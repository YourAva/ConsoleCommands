# Console Commands ‚úç

This is just a small C project that allows you to shutdown, restart and lock your windows computer with simple arguments. If you wish to run it, all you need to do is go to the directory it's stored in, and run "consoleCommands.exe [lock, shutdown, restart], which one you run is up to you.
